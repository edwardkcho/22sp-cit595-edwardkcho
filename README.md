# project0
My first project directory for CIT595.

This is my first project directory within my own repository in GitHub. One goal I have for this class is to brush up on my C skills and add to them. In addition, I have basic experience using Git management in my current job as a Software Developer such as adding changed files using "git add <file path>", check status using "git status", commiting those changes to my local branch "git commit -m "<insert message here>" and then pushing those changes. I hope to learn some more tips and tricks on Git management in this course.
